We added basic A* algorithm into our robocup3d project. Here is a demo about how to add our A* algorithm into your project.

Here are steps:
1. add AStarMath.cpp to your CMakeLists.txt
2. copy all source code of this project to yours(AStarBase.h & AStarMath.cpp)
3. refer to strategy.cc you can learn how to use our algorithm

For more details you can read the documention.pdf 

PS:
We would be pleased if this demo can help you make your soccer3d team better.
If there are any questions,please let us know.
